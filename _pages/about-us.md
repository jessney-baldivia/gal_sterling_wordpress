<h3>What is Galleon.ph?</h3>
The name <u>Galleon.ph</u> was adopted from the Spanish trading ships called Manila Galleons, which came to the Philippines once or twice a year to bring commodities back in 1500. Back in those days, the Filipinos traded their own produce for goods that are not available in the country. We have adopted this simple yet innovative idea.

Galleon.ph is the brainchild of two young entrepreneurs who dream of creating a never before seen or heard or heard kind of e-commerce website in the Philippines. <u>Galleon.ph</u> is here to give the same kind of excitement that the Filipinos had when they first laid eyes on the Manila Galleons.
<h3>Our Core Values</h3>
Our team at <u>Galleon.ph</u> believes it is more important to ask "Why are we here?" rather than "What we are here for?" To answer that, we are here because we strive to set new standards of how online shopping Philippines should be. We aim to give our Users the the excitement in discovering new innovative products never seen before - gadgets, apparels, electronics, kid‘s toys, and so much more! We take pride in making our customers satisfied and happy for every purchase they make.
