<h2>Cancellations, Returns and Refunds</h2>
All products that are sold on Galleon.ph are sourced from suppliers based in the USA and thus buyers should take into consideration the logistics process including the costs and delivery time of products to the Philippines. This idea is likewise applicable for the returned products that are to be shipped backed to the suppliers or manufacturers in the USA.
<h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
For orders that are unavailable or are delayed in fulfillment, we will first ask if customer is willing to wait for stock to be available or confirm if extended delivery date is acceptable. If not we will cancel the order and issue a 100% refund

For miscalculated shipping costs, our Customer Care will contact the you via phone call or email to check if you would be willing to give additional amount for shipping. In case the customer refuses, the order will be cancelled and we will process the full refund. In the same way, if shipping is over priced, we shall reimburse the excess to your credit card or bank account.

Regular and Custom Orders MAY be cancelled in case you made a mistake in placing the order. If item is not yet processed (ordered by our purchasing department), a Php 200 cancellation fee will be charged against you. On the other hand, order that has been processed cannot be cancelled anymore.
